## Functionality
* A user may input a city they'd like to view the weather for and current as well as future weather will be displayed to them.
* A user's prior searches are stored in a left-hand column. They are able to click on a city name and the weather data for that city will be displayed.
* Past searches are also saved to local storage and will be accessible on a page refresh.
* A user may also clear all prior searches should they so choose.
* A city's UV Index is color-coded to match UV index risk ranges [Green => Low, Yellow => Moderate, Orange => High, Red => Very High].
